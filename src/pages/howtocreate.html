                        <h2>Step 1</h2>

                        <p>To get the latest Trust Wallet App you should follow one of the download links on the website <a href="trustwallet.com">trustwallet.com</a></p>

                        <h2>Step 2.</h2>

                        <p>Once you have downloaded and installed the app, open Trust Wallet and tap on `Create a new wallet``. In the next step you will receive your 12 word recovery phrase, which acts as a backup for you funds.</p>
                        <p>IMPORTANT: There is no way to change or recover your 12 word phrase if it`s lost or forgotten.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you lose your recovery phrase you will lose your funds with it.</p>
                        <p>Trust Wallet is completely different from traditional bank accounts.</p>
                        <p>You are the true owner of your “Money”, Trust Wallet can never access your coins.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is technically not possible for us to recover wallets since we do not have access to your recovery phrase (only your 12 word recovery phrase can be used to restore access to your wallet).
                        </p>

                        <h2>Step 3.</h2>

                        <p>Before you finish the step of creating the wallet, verify that you wrote down the 12 word phrase in the correct order.</p>
                        <p>IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended to do your backup now and store it somewhere safe!
                        </p>
                        <p>And that`s it, you are done!
                            Your newly created multi-coin wallet is now ready to handle cryptocurrencies for over 30+ Blockchains, including Jupyter $IOM.</p>
